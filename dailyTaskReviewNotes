Task: Implement API CRUD Operations using Spring Boot

Objective:

Design and implement a RESTful API using Spring Boot that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API will also provide additional features to sort users based on timestamp, retrieve users with a timestamp greater than a specified value, and support ascending and descending sorting.

API Endpoints:

    Create User
        Endpoint: /api/user
        Method: POST
        Request Body: User object (JSON)
        Response: 201 Created with the created user object
    Sort Users by Timestamp
        Endpoint: /api/sort
        Method: GET
        Request Params: type (String, either "asc" or "desc")
        Response: 200 OK with an array of user objects sorted by timestamp
    Read All Users with Timestamp Greater Than
        Endpoint: /api/greaterThan
        Method: GET
        Request Params: timestamp (Long)
        Response: 200 OK with an array of user objects with timestamps greater than the 			 
        specified value
    Update User
        Endpoint: /api/users
        Method: PATCH
        Request Params: userId (integer)
        Request Body: User object (JSON)
        Response: 200 OK with the updated user object
    Delete User
        Endpoint: /api/users
        Method: DELETE
        Request Params: userId (integer)
        Response: 204 No Content

Learned:

    How to design and implement a RESTful API using Spring Boot
    How to use Spring Data JPA to interact with a database
    How to use Spring Boot's auto-configuration to simplify application development
    How to use Java annotations to define API endpoints and request/response bodies

Project Report: seapWebDataProvider

Project Overview

I have thoroughly reviewed the project code flow for seapWebDataProvider and gained a comprehensive understanding of its architecture and components.

Key Takeaways

During my review, I learned about the following key components of the project:

    Controller: The controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating tasks to the service layer. It uses Spring MVC framework and is annotated with @RestController.
    Exception Handling: The project uses a traditional exception way to handle.
    Repository: The repository layer is responsible for data access and uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the database. It provides a layer of abstraction between the business logic and the database.
    Dependency Injection: The project uses Spring's dependency injection mechanism to manage dependencies between components. It uses @Autowired annotation to inject dependencies into beans.
    Service Layer: The service layer is responsible for business logic and encapsulates the core functionality of the application. It uses @Service annotation and is injected with dependencies using @Autowired.

Report:

Task: Creating a RESTful API using Spring Boot

Objective: To design and implement a RESTful API using Spring Boot, incorporating logging, exception handling, and validation.

Summary:

In this task, I successfully created a RESTful API using Spring Boot, which includes the following features:

    Implemented Log4j logging in the project's pom.xml file
    Created an exception package and added validation dependency
    Developed a global Exception class to handle errors
    Designed and implemented REST endpoints for add, update, delete, and getAll operations
    Wrote logic for each endpoint to perform the respective CRUD operations

Learning Points:

    Spring Boot: I gained hands-on experience with Spring Boot, a popular framework for building web applications. I learned how to create a new project, configure dependencies, and use annotations to enable features like logging and exception handling.
    RESTful API Design: I understood the principles of designing RESTful APIs, including the use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource naming conventions, and request/response body formats (JSON).
    Logging with Log4j: I learned how to configure Log4j in a Spring Boot project, which is essential for monitoring and debugging applications.
    Exception Handling: I implemented a global Exception class to handle errors and exceptions in a centralized manner, making the code more robust and maintainable.
    Validation: I added validation dependency to ensure that incoming requests are validated before processing, which helps prevent errors and improves data integrity.

Report: Modifying Subsidiaries API

Introduction:

In this task, I was assigned to modify the Subsidiaries API rewrite the code. During this process, I learned several valuable lessons that I would like to share in this report.

Key Learnings:

    Avoid Unnecessary Complexity: I learned that adding extra features or code without a clear need can lead to maintainability problems. Instead, it's essential to focus on simplicity and only add functionality that is necessary.
    Code Organization: I understood the importance of keeping the code organized and structured. This makes it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase, reducing the likelihood of errors and making it easier to make future changes.

Best Practices:
    Keep it Simple: Avoid adding unnecessary complexity to the code. Focus on simplicity and only add functionality that is necessary.
    Organize Code: Keep the code organized and structured to make it easier to navigate and maintain.

Analysis of ClickHouse Tables and Understanding ClickHouse Functionality

As part of our group project, I was tasked with analyzing ClickHouse tables and gaining a deeper understanding of how ClickHouse works. In this report, I will outline my findings and provide an overview of the ClickHouse table I analyzed, as well as the commands used to retrieve, update, and delete data.

ClickHouse is a column-store database management system designed for real-time analytics. It is known for its high performance, scalability, and ease of use. ClickHouse allows for fast data ingestion, processing, and querying, making it an ideal choice for big data analytics.

Table Analysis: Advanced Linux Scan Table

I analyzed the advanced_linux_scan_table table, which contains data related to Linux system scans. The table has the following columns:

    id (primary key)
    scan_date
    scan_time
    hostname
    ip_address
    os_version
    kernel_version
    cpu_architecture
    memory_size
    disk_size

ObjectMapper and its Usage:

I also learned about ObjectMapper, a Java library used for serializing and deserializing Java objects to and from JSON. ObjectMapper is commonly used in conjunction with ClickHouse to convert data between Java objects and ClickHouse tables.

Template Paragraph:

"As part of the enhancement to the Host Table, I will add two new columns, Latitude and Longitude, to store the geographical coordinates of each host. This will enable the system to provide location-based information and improve data analysis capabilities. To achieve this, I will modify the existing data retrieval process to combine the new location data with the existing host information, ensuring seamless integration and accurate representation of host locations. The updated Host Table will provide a comprehensive view of each host, including their geographical coordinates, enabling more informed decision-making and enhanced system functionality."

I have continued to download data in the CVE format and validate it to ensure correct returns. Specifically, I have downloaded the required data from the designated source and verified its accuracy and completeness. 
Additionally, I have checked the data to ensure it is correctly formatted and meets the required standards.(9:00 to 1:00 and 1:40 to 7:00)

Thank you.

Use a Java library  iText to generate a PDF document with a card layout, containing the collected domain search data.

Design the card layout to display the domain search data in a clear and organized manner, including relevant fields such as domain name, registrar, and expiration date.

Validate the generated PDF document to ensure that the data is in the correct format and that all required fields are present.

Implement error handling mechanisms to handle any errors that may occur during the PDF generation or data validation process.Test the generated PDF document to ensure that it meets the required specifications and that the data is accurate and complete.

I will identify any challenges or issues that may arise during the task and develop a plan to resolve them.

Thank you.
